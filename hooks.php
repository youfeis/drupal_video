/**
 * @file
 * The video module has some hooks which should make adding
 * new features to the video module easier.
 *
 * This file contains example of implementation and documentation for
 * all the available hooks defined in the video module.
 *
 * Video module hooks are different from standard drupal hooks
 * Video module hooks have a leading "v_". The name of a function which
 * is implementing a video hook is something like: modulename_v_hookname
 *
 * Although each active module which implement a video module hooks
 * will be executed when that hook is called, if you are developing a
 * video module specific addition (a plug in) I suggest you to call your
 * module video_something and place it under your video module plugins folder.
